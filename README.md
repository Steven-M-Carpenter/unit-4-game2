GAME:
A darker twist on the Star Wars game, but with the same functionality.  

FEATURES:
Two images per character - one angry face - one packing heat for going to battle.
A pretty sweet background of packing peanuts custom blurred to soften it a bit.

TO LOSE:    Choose Charlie as the attacker
            Take on Peppermint Patty first
            Take on Lucy second
            Take on Linus third

TO WIN:     Just about anything other than the sequence above.

CODE:
It's working, but it's ugly.  Ran out of time to clean it up proper.


Enjoy!
